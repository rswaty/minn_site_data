## The basics

There is a need to explore basic tree demographic data for TNC's restoration sites in northern Minnesota.  Based of the dataset [CLEAN_data_Fall2022_from_NM.xlsx](data/CLEAN_data_Fall2022_from_NM.xlsx) I:

1. Used pivot tables to generate clean [overstory](data/overstory.csv) and understory datasets
2. Made some basic data exploration charts

## Future hopes

1. Have clickable map
2. Explore treatment impacts on  basal area and # understory dbh
